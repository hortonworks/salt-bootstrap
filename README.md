# Salt Bootstrap

SaltStack is a configuration management software which delivers fast & scalable event-driven infrastructure automated. But how you configure SaltStack itself if your cluster infrastructure created dynamically by automatized tools. That's where Salt Bootstrap comes in picture.
Salt Bootstrap is part of [Cloudbreak](https://github.com/sequenceiq/cloudbreak) project. It's responsibility to configure SaltStack master and minions cluster wide, manage service life-cycle on members of the cluster and distribute common states, formulas, templates generated by the orchestrator tool. Salt Bootstrap provides a secured interface to spin up SaltStack cluster instead of executing plain ssh commands on each members.
